The second line is the new way of doing this. JavaScript got a large update in 2015 and it made things a lot easier. Now you can use the back tick (notice the first uses a double quote, you must use back ticks to do template strings) to do template strings. If you do that, anything inside of ${yourVariableHere} gets output in the string. Cool, right? */
